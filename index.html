            <h3>Weather-App</h3>
            <p>I developed a Weather App that provides real-time weather information for cities
                worldwide. This application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display
                current weather conditions, including temperature, weather type, and date. Users can
                search for specific cities to access accurate weather data, making it a valuable tool for
                staying informed about weather conditions.

            <h3>Text-To-Speech-Convertor</h3>
            <p>Developed a web-based Text To Speech Converter utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                This application allows users to enter text into a textarea and convert it into audible
                speech with the click of a button. It leverages the SpeechSynthesis API for seamless
                speech generation.
